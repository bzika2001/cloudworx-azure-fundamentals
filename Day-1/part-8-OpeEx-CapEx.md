## Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)

There are two cost when running your physical infrastructure.

### CapEx computing costs 
( *number of resources your are using*)
- Pay as go model
- Bill is generated immediately
- No depreciation
- Server costs
- Storage costs
- Backup and archive costs
- Organization continuity and disaster recovery costs
- Datacenter infrastructure costs
- Technical personnel

### OpEx cloud computing costs 
( *Kind of subscription which you are using traditionally physical server you have got*)

- Upfront spending money on physical infrastructure
- Cost have a value which reduces overtime.
- Leasing software and customized features
- Scaling charges based on usage/demand instead of fixed hardware or capacity
- Billing at the user or organization level

## Real Life Example
Think of it like this: imagine you need a car. You have two main ways to get one:

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx): Buying the Car

- **What it is**: This is like buying the car outright. It's a big, upfront cost for an asset that you'll use over a long period.
  
- **Characteristics**:
   - **Upfront Cost**: You pay a significant amount of money at the beginning.
   - **Ownership**: You own the asset (the car).   
   - **Depreciation**: Over time, the value of the asset decreases, and you account for this depreciation.   
   - **Less Flexibility**: Once you buy it, you're committed. If your needs change quickly, you might be stuck with a car that's too big, too small, or not quite right.
   - **Example in IT (On-Premises)**: Buying servers, networking hardware, storage devices, and the physical data center building itself. You make a large initial investment.

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx): Using a Ride-Sharing Service

What it is: This is like using a ride-sharing service. You pay as you go for the service you consume. There's no big upfront cost of owning the car.
- **Characteristics:**
    - **Pay-as-you-go**: You only pay for what you use, when you use it.   
    - **No Ownership**: You don't own the underlying asset (the car belongs to the ride-sharing company).
    - **Tax Deductible (Usually)**: These costs are typically treated as operating expenses for tax purposes.
    - **High Flexibility**: You can easily scale up or down your usage based on your needs. If you need a bigger car for a trip with friends, you just book one. If you don't need a car at all, you don't pay.   
    - **Example in Azure (Cloud)**: Paying for virtual machines by the hour, storage by the gigabyte used, and the cost of services as you consume them. There's no big upfront hardware purchase.   

## Azure's Big Advantage: Shifting from CapEx to OpEx

One of the major benefits of Azure is that it allows organizations to shift their IT spending from a primarily CapEx model to an OpEx model. Instead of buying and maintaining their own infrastructure, they pay for the computing resources they consume as a service.

**Here's a simple table to summarize:**

|Feature         |	Capital Expenditure (CapEx)|	Operational Expenditure (OpEx)|
| ---------------| --------------------------- |:-------------------------------|
|**Upfront Cost**|	High                       |	Low                           |
|**Ownership**	 | Yes                         |	No                            |
|**Payment**	   | Large, initial investment   |	Ongoing, pay-as-you-go        |
|**Flexibility** |	Low                        |	High                          |
|**Accounting**  |	Depreciation               |	Operating expense             |
|**Example (IT)**|	Buying servers             |Paying for Azure VMs            |

## Why is this important for AZ-900?

Understanding the OpEx vs. CapEx model is crucial because it highlights a key economic advantage of cloud computing. Azure enables businesses to:

- **Reduce upfront costs**: No need for massive initial investments in hardware.
- **Improve cash flow**: Predictable, ongoing operational expenses instead of large capital outlays.   
- **Increase agility**: Easily scale resources up or down without being locked into owned infrastructure.
   
So, when you think about Azure's financial benefits, remember the shift from owning (CapEx) to renting/using (OpEx)!
